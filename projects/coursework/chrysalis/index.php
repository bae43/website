Awards:

1st place -  Class Raytracer Rendering Competition</a>

Chrysalis is a raytracing renderer that supports
	* Lambert and Blinn-Phong materials (plastics) 	
	* Reflective "glazed" materials (metals)
	* transparent and refractive surface materials (glass and water)
	* Orthographic and perspective cameras
	* Depth of Field (DOF)
	* importing .obj models
	* UV maps and texturing
	
The last three features listed were extensions not covered in the class, but we added for use in our submission to the class's annual Raytracer Competition. Our submission "Misty Morning" won first place.
